PRD: Medication Lookup Tool
1. User Problem Statement
Who is this website for? This tool is for Maria Rodriguez (volunteer coordinator), Dr. James Chen (physician), and the 12,000 low-income patients at Hope Street Health Center in South Los Angeles. These patients are primarily uninsured or underinsured individuals from marginalized communities who lost access to basic healthcare information during the 43-day government shutdown.
What problem are they facing? The clinic's Electronic Health Records system and medication database subscriptions lapsed during the shutdown. Patients are showing up with unlabeled pill bottles, expired prescriptions, and no memory of what their medications are for. Without access to expensive medication databases, clinic staff can't quickly answer basic questions like "What is this pill?" or "Can I take this with food?"
Why do they need this tool?
Medication errors kill 7,000+ Americans annually and send 1.3 million to ERs
A single ER visit can cost $2,000-$10,000 financially devastating for patients earning $18,000/year
Hope Street patients can't afford $200 pharmacist consultations or telehealth services
Many patients have limited English proficiency and need simple, clear medication information
Dr. Chen is the only physician for 12,000 patients. He can't spend 15 minutes explaining every pill

2. Core Features List
Feature 1: Medication Search Function
Users will type a medication name into a search bar and see instant results from your CSV database. The search will be case-insensitive (works whether they type "Lisinopril" or "lisinopril") and will show "No results found" if the medication isn't in the database yet.
Technical Implementation:
HTML input field with real-time search
Display matching results in clean, readable format
